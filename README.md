# The Pact Sample Project Based on pact-jvm-provider-junit_2.11. 

The repo "pact-ec-app" demonstrates an e-commerce application which depends on the "pact-ec-review-service" restful service. The former (as a consumer) requests the latter (as a provider) to provide rating information (such as a 3-star of a 5-star rating) for a product on the e-commerce website with product id and user name.

The repo "pact-ec-review-service" is the sample project to show how to use the pact-jvm-provider-junit_2.11. 

# How to Run It

0. Generate the pact (i.e. contract) of the sample application according to the README.md in the repo ["pact-ec-app"](https://github.com/wubin28/pact-ec-app).
1. Git clone the ["pact-ec-review-service"](https://github.com/wubin28/pact-ec-review-service) repo.
3. Copy the pact file generated in the consumer side in step 0 to the folder "src/test/resources" of the provider project folder.
4. Run command "./gradlew clean test"
